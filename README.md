## Install Plugin
* Discover it on npmjs.com @ [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-wso2-apim)

* `yarn add -D serverless-wso2-apim`   
or   
`npm install --save serverless-wso2-apim`  

* Then in `serverless.yml` add following entry to the plugins array:
  ```yml

    - serverless-wso2-apim
  ```

## Using the Plugin

- Make sure you have a Serverless project set up as described [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).  

- Add configuration options to your Serverless configuration, as below.
  ```yml
  custom:
    wso2apim:
      host: 'wso2-apimanager.com' # WSO2 API Manager Host
      port: 443 # WSO2 API Manager Port
      versionSlug: 'v0.14'  # WSO2 API Manager's Management API version
      user: 'user@tenant' # Username, with tenant symbol
      pass: 'pass' # Password
      gatewayEnv: 'Production'  # Target Gateway Environment
  ```

- Add one or more API definitions to your Serverless configuration, as below.

  ```yml
  apidefs:
    - myAwesomeAPI: # Identifier of your API definition
      name: 'MyAwesomeAPI'  # Name of API that shows up in WSO2 API Console (CANNOT BE UPDATED LATER)
      description: 'My Awesome API'
      rootContext: '/myawesomeapi'  # Runtime context of API which will be appended to the base URL exposed by WSO2 API Gateway. Must be unique across the Gateway Environment. (CANNOT BE UPDATED LATER)
      version: 'v1' # Version, which also forms a part of the API URL ultimately (CANNOT BE UPDATED LATER)
      visibility: 'PUBLIC'  # Accessible from Public Internet, Visible to everyone
      backend: 
        http: # HTTP-based Backends
          baseUrl: 'https://backend:port/123'  # Backend RESTful base URL
          publicCertChain: './certs/backend.cer'  # Optional, public certificate chain in PEM base64 format
      maxTps: 100 # Throttling, Transactions per second
      tags:
        - my-awesome-api
        - awesomeness
      swaggerSpec:  # Swagger specification in YML, currently supports 2.0
        swagger: '2.0'
        ...
        info:
          ...
        paths:
          ...
  ```

- Run `sls deploy apidefs` to create-and-publish (or) update-and-republish API definitions (and associated backend certificates, if mentioned) in WSO2 API Manager.

- Run `sls list apidefs` to view the status of API deployment on WSO2 API Manager.

- Run `sls list certs` to view the status of backend certificate availability.

- Run `sls remove apidefs` to delete API definitions when there are no active subscriptions made to those APIs.

- Run `sls remove certs` to delete backend certificates when they are found.


- ** COMING SOON **   
Run `sls remove apidefs --force` (** USE WITH CAUTION **) to forcefully delete API definitions despite any active subscriptions. It will retire, deprecate and delete API definitions if they cannot be deleted normally.


## Limitations and Backlog items
* Limited to creation of RESTful APIs using Swagger 2.0 on WSO2 API Manager. 
* Limited to WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0 which uses v0.14 as management API version. 
* Does not support managing APIs which are already created in another manner without using this Plugin.
* Does not work with Websocket-style APIs.  
* Does not support publishing API definitions to multiple Gateway environments.  
* Does not support CORS configuration.
